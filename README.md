# SQL (Smile query language)

Simple query language to be able to tranfer data between big human and tiny human. The interface is based on the expression of the face, particularly, the lips and mouth area.

The language contains two tokens to represent each state: happy or sad:

## Happy

## Sad

# Take over

This interface will allow the tiny human to express emotions so the big human can react accordingly.
